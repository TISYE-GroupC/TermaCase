\subsection{SPS\_PCU}
The Power Conditioning Unit is responsible for receiving high voltage AC power from the F-16 power supply, converting it to low voltage DC power and distributing it to the MWS and the DSS's.

\subsection{SPS\_MWS}
The Missile Warning System is responsible for monitoring the planes surroundings for incoming missiles.
When a missile is identified as being in the path of the plane, the MWS will signal the cockpit unit in order to let the pilot take appropriate action.

\subsection{SPS\_DSS\_XX}
The Digital Sequencer Switches are responsible for powering and firing chaff/flare magazines on command from the MWS.

\subsection{SPS\_Magazine\_XX}
The magazines contains the payloads to be dispensed.

\subsection{SPS\_CU}
The Cockpit Unit receives input from the pilot and communicates with the MWS and the mission computer.
