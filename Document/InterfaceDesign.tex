\section{Interface design}

\subsection{Power interfaces}
All the interfaces specified in the following subsections are power interfaces.

\subsubsection{P\_1.1}
The P\_1.1 interface delivers power from the F-16 power supply to the SPS\_PCU. The power delivered is 115 VAC 400 Hz. Up to 250W will be consumed by the SPS\_PCU.

\subsubsection{P\_2.X}
All the interfaces named P\_2.1-2.4 are power interfaces from the F-16 power supply to each DSS. The power delivered is 115 VAC 400 Hz. Up to 126W will be consumed by each DSS.

\subsubsection{P\_3.X}
All the interfaces named P\_3.1-3.4 are power interfaces from the SPS\_PCU to each DSS. The power delivered is 28V DC. 3W will be consumed by each DSS.

\subsubsection{P\_4.1}
The P\_4.1 interface delivers power from the SPS\_PCU to the MWS. The power delivered is 28V DC. Up to 85W will be consumed by the MWS.

\subsubsection{P\_5.1}
The P\_5.1 interface delivers power from the F-16 PCU to the SPS\_CU. The power delivered is 28V DC. Up to 10W will be consumed by the SPS\_CU.


\subsection{Communication and control interfaces}

\subsubsection{CC\_1.X}
The interfaces CC\_1.1-1.4 are used for control of each DSS by the MWS. 

\subsubsection{CC\_2.X}
The interfaces CC\_2.1-2.8 are used for igniting payloads by the DSS'.

\subsubsection{CC\_3.1}
The interface CC\_3.1 are used to turn on/off the power to the pod from the cockpit unit.


\subsection{Multi connect bus interfaces}

\subsubsection{MCB\_1.1}
\begin{enumerate}[label = \bfseries ID-\arabic*]
\setcounter{enumi}{0}

\item The interface is of type real-time data transfer and will have a maximal time of providing measured data in under 5 ms. (SR-19)

\item The interface sets 3 different modes up to be chosen; automatic, semi-automatic and manual. (SR-1,2,3)

\item The interface provides two angles for each threat detected -- the first is 180 degree vertical, the second is 360 degree horizontal. (SR-6, SR-7 (SR-9?))

\item The interface provides a list of patterns the flares can be dispatched in.

\item The interface provides a launch message for manual mode and semi-automatic mode to launch flares in the selected pattern.
