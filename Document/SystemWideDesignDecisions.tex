\chapter{System-wide design decisions}


\section{Inputs and outputs}
%Design decisions regarding inputs the system will accept and outputs it will produce.

\begin{enumerate}[label= DDD-1.\arabic*:]

\item The mission computer shows which mode the system is in. \label{DDD-11}

\item The mission warning system provides a signal with a threat's location to the intercom system.\label{DDD-12}

\item The mission computer shows how many flairs are left.\label{DDD-13}

\item The mission computer shows if all DSSs are available.\label{DDD-14}

\item The pilot can select mode with a physical unit -- either a button, flip switch or turn switch.\label{DDD-15}

\item The pilot can select to fire flares of the selected pattern with a click of a button.\label{DDD-16}

\item The maintenance crew can load flares form 8 hatches in the pod.\label{DDD-17}

\item The pilot can turn off the power to the pod by clicking a button, flicking a switch or turning a switch.\label{DDD-18}

\end{enumerate}




\section{System behavior and performance characteristics}
%Design decisions on system behavior in response to each input or condition, including actions the system will perform, response times and other performance characteristics.

\begin{enumerate}[label= DDD-2.\arabic*:]

\item The time it takes for the new mode to appear from the pilot selects a new mode shall be less than 30 ms.\label{DDD-21}

\item When flairs are fired the status sent to the Mission Computer shall be updated in less than 30 ms.\label{DDD-22}

\item If the pilot turns on the pod after it has been disabled, the pod shall be ready in under 500 ms.\label{DDD-23}

\end{enumerate}




\section{Data appearance}
%Design decisions on how system databases/data files will appear to the user.

\begin{enumerate}[label= DDD-3.\arabic*:]

\item The selected mode shall be shown as text in the Cockpit Unit.\label{DDD-31}

\end{enumerate}

\section{Physical appearance}
%Design and construction choices for hardware or hardware-software systems, such as physical size, color, shape, weight, materials, and markings
\begin{enumerate}[label= DDD-4.\arabic*:]

\item The pod shall be mounted on the aircraft's left wing with standard T-hooks spaced by 13 inches.(SR-28)\label{DDD-41}

\item The pod must be no longer than 120 cm, no wider than 40 cm, no taller 40 cm and aerodynamic. (RFPS, SR-3.1)\label{DDD-42}

\item The pod shall be colored in light gray (FS 26373).\label{DDD-43}

\item The pod shall only have marking of font size 60 pt Impact in black (\#000000).\label{DDD-44}

\end{enumerate}
