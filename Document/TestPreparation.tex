\chapter{Test preparations}
This section describes the preparations needed to be done before going ahead with the tests.
Generally the test are to be done on fully assembled systems.

It is important that the tests are performed in the order they are described, to ensure validity of results.

\section{Test 1}
\textbf{Description: }\\
The test purely entail a weighing of the pod structure with all systems installed.

\textbf{Preparations: }\\
For this test a fully assembled pod is needed. 

It is not necessary to be connected to the cockpit unit or have final software running.

\section{Test 2}
\textbf{Description: }\\
The test validates all internal and external communication in the pod. Further, it validates the power consumption of the pod.

\textbf{Preparations: }\\
In order to perform the test, a fully assembled pod is needed, including hardware and software. A testbench, simulating the interface of an F-16 aircraft, is also needed.


\section{Test 3}
\textbf{Description: }\\
The test validates the sustainability of the pod, when exposed to acceleration.

\textbf{Preparations: }\\
A fully assembled pod is needed for this test. 

The pod shall be mounted in a centrifuge, when performing this test.
The centrifuge must be able to generate an acceleration of 25g.

Software performing self-test of the pod is needed to validate the sustainability.

\section{Test 4}
\textbf{Description: }\\
The test validates the sustainability of the pod, when exposed to high temperature.

\textbf{Preparations: }\\
A fully assembled pod is needed for this test. 

A temperature test chamber should be available to perform this test.

Software performing self-test of the pod is needed to validate the sustainability.

\section{Test 5}
\textbf{Description: }\\
The test validates the integration of all system components.

\textbf{Preparations: }\\
A F-16 aircraft must be available to perform this test. The Cockpit Unit must be installed in the aircraft.
A fully assembled pod and complete software is needed.
