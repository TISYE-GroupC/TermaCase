\chapter{Scope}

\section{Identification}
This System Requirement Specification (SRS) identifies, specifies and establishes the detailed system requirement for the Dismounted COP as set forth by the Request of Proposal from Systematic.
The SRS further specifies the methods to be used to ensure that each requirement has been met. 

The component envisioned by Systematic is a black tablet device with a touch interface. The device will be
used as a hand held device for presenting a Common Operation Picture. The Common Operation Picture
enables the commander to achieve an overview of a crisis situation. The Common Operations Picture also
enables communication between the commander and various actors. (E.g. fire departments, hospitals, etc.)
The scope of this project concerns development, production and maintenance of a hardware solution. 
It is expected that the solution may require commercially available terminals, middleware and protocols.

\section{System overview}
The purpose of the SRS is to provide Systematic with a dismounted COP.
