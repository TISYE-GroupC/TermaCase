\chapter{System architectural design}
\section{System functional design}
This section describes the functional design and architecture of the system.
This is also illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:FFD} below.

\subsection{System functions}
\begin{enumerate}[label=F.\arabic*:]
\item Accept User selection of dispensing pattern
\item Accept User selection of operational mode
\item Receive dispensing pattern programs
\item Receive payload magazines
\item Distribute electricity
\item Support weight
\item Detect threats
\item Convert power AC/DC
\item Ignite payloads

Accepts pattern input from F.1 and "fire" command from F.15 and ignites payloads in the given pattern.

\item Communicate threat info to F-16 Mission Computer

Accepts threat information from F.7 and outputs it to the F-16 Mission Computer.

\item Communicate threat info to F-16 Intercom System

Accepts threat information from F.7 and outputs it to the F-16 Intercom System.

\item Receive "Fire" command

Accepts "Fire" command from the User in the form of a physical button, and outputs it to F.15.

\item Lock dispensing system

Accepts "lock" signal from the F-16 Mission Computer, and outputs it to F.15.

\item Toggle pod power supply

Accepts on/off signal from the User in the form of a physical switch , and outputs it to F.5.

\item Validate "fire" command

Accepts "lock" input from F.13, "mode" input from F.2, "fire" input from F.7 or F.12, and outputs a "fire" command to F.9.

\end{enumerate}


In Figure \ref{fig:ComponentsAndInterfaces} an overview of the the complete systems components and interfaces is shown. Each component and interface will described and linked with system requirements in the following sections.
