\chapter{System architectural design}
\section{System functional design}
This section describes the functional design and architecture of the system.
This is also illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:FFD} below.

\subsection{System functions}
\begin{enumerate}[label=F.\arabic*]
\item Accept User selection of dispensing pattern

Accepts dispensing pattern selection from the User in the form of a physical switch input, and outputs it to \ref{enum:Ignite}.

\item Accept User selection of operational mode

Accepts operational mode selection from the User in the form of a physical switch input, and outputs it to \ref{enum:Val}.

\item Receive dispensing pattern programs

Receives and saves predetermined chaff/flare dispensing programs

\item Receive payload magazines

Receives and stores payload magazines, ready for use

\item Distribute electricity

Distributes HV AC Power from the F-16 Power Supply and distributes it the all functions that require it (F.7-9)

\item Support weight

Distributes the weight of system to the suspension structure and the F-16 hard-point

\item Detect threats

Scans surroundings for incoming threats and alerts F.10-11. It also commands \ref{enum:Val} to fire in case of automatic operation mode.

\item Convert power AC/DC

Converts high voltage AC power from the F-16 Power Supply to 28V DC power and distributes it to the function that require it (F.7,9-11,13,15)

\item Ignite payloads\label{enum:Ignite}

Accepts pattern input from F.1 and "fire" command from F.15 and ignites payloads in the given pattern.

\item Communicate threat info to F-16 Mission Computer

Accepts threat information from F.7 and outputs it to the F-16 Mission Computer.

\item Communicate threat info to F-16 Intercom System

Accepts threat information from F.7 and outputs it to the F-16 Intercom System.

\item Receive "Fire" command

Accepts "Fire" command from the User in the form of a physical button, and outputs it to F.15.

\item Lock dispensing system

Accepts "lock" signal from the F-16 Mission Computer, and outputs it to F.15.

\item Toggle pod power supply

Accepts on/off signal from the User in the form of a physical switch , and outputs it to F.5.

\item Validate "fire" command\label{enum:Val}

Accepts "lock" input from F.13, "mode" input from F.2, "fire" input from F.7 or F.12, and outputs a "fire" command to F.9.
